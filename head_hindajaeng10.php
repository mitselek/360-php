Our goals suppose permanent development of ourselves. To get better results we must find better opportunities.<br>
First of all, for developing our organisation we should develop ourselves.
</div> 
      <div class="lead">
We have agreed that our Corporate Values are Honesty, Initiative and Teamwork. 
The last one can be compared to an orchestra. Even the best solo-players do not sound good enough if they do not take others into account.
</div> 
      <div class="lead">
We started 360<sup>o</sup> feedback last year. It served a basis for developmental programs. Every given feedback was important to make a general picture. I am sure it helped a lot.<br>
This year we will check the changes. Questions included into 360   support managerial priorities.
</div> 
      <div class="lead">
I ask You to participate for sure. Please give Your honest opinion - the quality of our managers should become our competitive advantage.</div>
